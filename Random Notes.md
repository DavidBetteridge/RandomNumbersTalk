What can we do with random numbers?
    Well we can calculate PI

    Will not be perfect

And we can play games - for example shuffle a pack of cards  (expand if needed)

    What is want another go?  Well you need to shuffle the pack in the same way.

What happens if we don't specify a seed

    Show both in .net framework and .net core  copy code for console app 2  (hide solution explorer)

        Start both

            Console.Title = "ConsoleApp1";
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            {
                var seed = Environment.TickCount;
                var rnd = new Random(seed);
                var number = rnd.Next(1, 6);
                Console.WriteLine(number);
            }
            Console.ReadLine();

            Change core version
                var seed = Environment.TickCount;
                var r = new Random(seed);
            
            Fix framework version
                var rnd = new Random();
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)

How are pseudorandom numbers created?
            MiddleSquareMethod

            The very first software algorithm to generate random numbers, was supposedly written in 1946 by John von Neumann

            To generate a sequence of n-digit pseudorandom numbers, an n-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2n-digit number. If the result has fewer than 2n digits, leading zeroes are added to compensate. The middle n digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence, and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers.

                Two issues
                    One - very predictable
                    Two - most seeds converge to zero



Secure?
Cryptographic RNGs (also known as "cryptographically strong" or "cryptographically secure" RNGs) seek to generate random numbers that not only "look random", but are cost-prohibitive to guess. Cryptographic RNGs are RECOMMENDED for applications that use random numbers for information security, such asâ€”
